### Plan Adherence

You are evaluating an agent run from the AssistantBench benchmark.

Determine whether the agent follows its stated or implied plan throughout execution.

Label “match” if:
- The agent’s actions follow the steps outlined in its plan.
- Deviations are explicitly justified by new information or errors.
- The plan is updated when necessary and subsequent actions reflect the update.

Label “no match” if:
- The agent deviates from its plan without explanation.
- Planned steps are abandoned without justification.
- Actions contradict the stated plan or goals.

Explanation:
Briefly cite the stated or inferred plan and where it was followed or violated.
